The aim of this project is to learn the use of functional/class/HOC React components, React-Router, CSS modules, Redux and asynchronous requests with Firebase.

I have borrowed parts of this project from a [Udemy course taught by Maximilian Schwarzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) while implemented ideas of my own.

You can see the progress of this project by running ```npm start``` after ```npm install``` assuming Node and NPM is installed on your local machine.
